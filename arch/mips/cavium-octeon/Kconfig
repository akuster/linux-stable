	bool "Build the kernel to be used only on OCTEON II or OCTEON III processor cores"
	default "n"
	help
	  This option enables the generation of Octeon2 specific
	  instructions by the compiler, resulting in a kernel that is
	  more efficient, but that will not run on Octeon and
	  OcteonPlus processor cores.

	default "n"
	help
	  The CN63XXP1 chip require build time workarounds to
	  function reliably, select this option to enable them.  These
	  workarounds will cause a slight decrease in performance on
	  non-CN6XXX hardware.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_EXTRA_CVMSEG
	int "Number of extra L1 cache lines reserved for CVMSEG memory"
	range 0 50
	default 0
	help
	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache
	  as a local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the
	  cache is.  The kernel uses two or three blocks (one for TLB
	  exception handlers, one for driver IOBDMA operations, and on
	  models that need it, one for LMTDMA operations). This
	  selects an optional extra number of CVMSEG lines for use by
	  other software.

	  Normally no extra lines are required, and this parameter
	  should be set to zero.

	bool "Enable fast access to the thread pointer"
	default "y"
	help
	  For Mips, normally the TLS thread pointer is accessed by the
	  userspace program executing a "rdhwr" from register $29. This
	  register does not exist, so the kernel emulates the instruction
	  assigning the thread pointer to the value register. This option
	  supplies an alternate, faster access to the thread pointer. A
	  side effect of this option is that the highest 8 bytes of CVMSEG
	  is used by the kernel to save and restore the thread pointer during
	  the TLB fault handlers. This CVMSEG address is not available to user
	  applications.
